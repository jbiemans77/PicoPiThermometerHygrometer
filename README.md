# PicoPiThermometerHygrometer
A Thermometer and Hygrometer for a Pico Pi to check climate of a terrarium.

This is a project I created for the final assignment for CS50.  It is a micropython program that runs on a Pico Pi.  It reads the temprature and humidity data from a sensor, and then outputs that information to an LCD screen for easy viewing.  There are also 3 thresholds that are fully customizable. By default, the settings are:

Good = Ideal temprature +- 5 (degrees or %) - The screen will be green.
Warn = Ideal temprature +- 5-10 (degrees or %) - The screen will be amber.
Alarm = Ideal temprature > 10 (degrees or %) - The screen will be red.

Both the colors, and theresholds can be set in the global variables at the top of the program:
GOOD_COLOR = [0,255,0]
WARN_COLOR = [255,209,0]
ALARM_COLOR = [255,0,0]

WARNING_THRESHOLD = 5
ALARM_THRESHOLD = 10

The time that it will wait before switching between temprature and humidity:
SCREEN_REFRESH_DELAY = 5

Additional sensors or species can easily be added to the code on the fly if you want to use multiple sensors at a time.  Please see the comments of the code to see how to add them.

I plan to design an enclosure for the Pico and sensor that can be 3D printed and I will add it here once it has been made and tested.

If anyone has questions, I will do my best to answer.
